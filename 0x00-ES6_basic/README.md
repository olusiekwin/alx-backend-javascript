# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the 0x00. ES6 Basics project! This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) in JavaScript. ES6 introduced several new features and syntax enhancements to the language, improving developer productivity and code readability.

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript programming
- Software Linter

## Resources

To complete this project, you should read or watch the following resources:

- [ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)
- Statements and declarations
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameter
- [Javascript ES6 â€” Iterables and Iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what ES6 is and its significance in JavaScript development.
- Describe the new features introduced in ES6, such as arrow functions, default parameters, and template literals.
- Differentiate between constants and variables, including block-scoped variables.
- Understand arrow functions and their usage, including default function parameters.
- Utilize rest and spread function parameters effectively.
- Implement string templating in ES6.
- Create objects and manipulate their properties using ES6 syntax.
- Work with iterators and for-of loops to iterate over collections.

## Requirements

### General

- All files must execute on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- Ensure all files end with a new line.
- Include a mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Use the .js extension for all code files.
- Test your code using the Jest Testing Framework.
- Analyze your code using the ESLint linter with specific rules provided.
- Export all functions from your code.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
nodejs -v
npm -v
```

2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint:

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration Files

Add the following files to your project directory:

1. **package.json**

2. **babel.config.js**

3. **.eslintrc.js**

## Finally...

After adding the configuration files, remember to run `npm install` from your project folder's terminal to install all necessary dependencies.

Good luck with your ES6 Basics project! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
