- Typed Array
- Set Data Structure
- Map Data Structure
- WeakMap

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain how to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays
- Understand typed arrays
- Describe the characteristics of Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures

## Requirements
- Operating Environment: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- File Endings: All files should end with a new line
- Mandatory Files: README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code Extension: Use the .js extension for your code files
- Testing: Your code will be tested using Jest (run with `npm run test`)
- Linting: Verify your code against ESLint (run with `npm run full-test`)
- Function Export: All functions must be exported

## Setup
### Install NodeJS 12.11.x
In your home directory, execute the following commands:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
nodejs -v
npm -v
```
Expected output:
```
v12.11.1
6.11.3
```

### Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint
In your project directory, install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by running `npm install`. Make sure to add the provided configuration files (`package.json`, `babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`) to your project directory.

Don't forget to run `npm install` when you have the `package.json`.
